# Library Management System

The **Library Management System** is a database-driven application designed to streamline library operations, developed as part of a Database Management Systems (DBMS) course. This project was collaboratively built by **Muhammad Usman**, **Asma Channa**, and **Soyam Kapoor**, under the supervision of **Ma'am Zainab Umair**. It leverages a MySQL database and a Python Tkinter GUI to provide an efficient, user-friendly platform for managing library resources.

The system supports two user roles: **Admin** (for managing books, members, transactions, and reports) and **User** (for searching/viewing books and tracking borrowed items). It emphasizes robust database design and intuitive interface to meet library management needs.

## Key Features

The Library Management System offers the following core functionalities:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with role-based access for admins and users.
- **Book Management**: Add, search, and view books in the library inventory.
- **Member Management**: Register and view library patrons’ details.
- **Transaction Management**: Issue and return books, and track borrowed or overdue items.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on overdue books, transaction summaries, and export data for further analysis.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive navigation through a graphical interface with interactive tables and quick-access buttons.
